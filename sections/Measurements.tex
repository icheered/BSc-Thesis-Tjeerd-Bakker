\chapter{Measurements}
This chapter of the report is concerned with comparing different techniques of estimating the EMG amplitude.

\section{Experimental setup}
The actual measuring of force data. Mention that 600g was used in an initial experiment but it yielded odd data (list possible sources: muscle contraction was very little, lot of noise in room, shield maybe not working, LOFF not working, too many channels?), so a heavier load cell was used for more correct estimation.

What did I measure, how did I measure it, where did I measure it. What did I record, what do I expect to see?

Mention hardware used (adc, load cell,) and calibration tests done.
\section{Measurement results}
Data that was NOT working, data that WAS working, notable characteristics of the data


\section{Conclusion}
Draw numeric conclusion from data, in which situations is which filter how much better?
