\chapter{Discussion and conclusion}
\section{Discussion}


describe what your results mean and how they are an important contribution to the research field.

- short signal sample of MVC and noise
- no load cell measurement


What does it all mean?
◼ What hypotheses were proved or disproved?
◼ What did we learn?
◼ Why is it important (enough to report)?
\section{Conclusion}
In this report a complete signal processing chain for sEMG signals was presented. Within each step in this processing chain multiple processing techniques were discussed and tested to illustrate their behaviour and performance when applied to sEMG signals. 



Summarize your key findings. Include important conclusions that can be drawn and further implications for the field. Discuss benefits or shortcomings of your work and suggest future areas for research.

High-level conclusion that was not previously mentioned (The adaptive filter is better in X situation but at the cost of Y)

Summarize general trends in the data without comment, bias, or interpretation.
◼ Should add a new, higher level of analysis, and explicitly indicate the importance
of the work
◼ Do not repeat the Results section, unless special emphasis is needed
◼ Conclusions are not a summary of the work!

\section{Recommendations}
Further research, suggestions for better results
