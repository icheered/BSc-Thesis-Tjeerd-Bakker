\chapter{Discussion and conclusion}
\section{Discussion}
The research question presented in the introduction states the goal of finding the best combination of whitening, filtering, and envelope detection to estimate force from sEMG. 

From the measurement results presented in figure \ref{fig:result_all_lagerrorscaling} the conclusion can be drawn that a processing chain consisting of no pre-whitening, no filtering, and infinite impulse response butterworth lowpass filter for envelope detection yields the best accuracy for force estimating. It has the lowest error rate of all techniques and introduces no lag.

This gives the suggestion that improving the signal to noise ratio of an sEMG signal does not result in a better estimation of the applied force. It should be noted that these conclusions are drawn from a single measurement at a single location and thus may yield different results in different environments. 

Another interesting observation can be made from the Lag comparison subplot in figure \ref{fig:result_all_lagerrorscaling}: only signal processing chains that use whitening appear to introduce lag.

\section{Conclusion}
In this report a complete signal processing chain for sEMG signals was presented. Within each step in this processing chain various processing techniques were discussed and tested to illustrate their behaviour and performance when applied to sEMG signals. 



Summarize your key findings. Include important conclusions that can be drawn and further implications for the field. Discuss benefits or shortcomings of your work and suggest future areas for research.
