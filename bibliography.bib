abstract = {Introduction: Preserving functional abilities of the upper extremities is a major concern in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). To assess disease progression and treatments, good knowledge on arm function in boys with DMD is essential. Therefore, feasibility and validity of the use of surface electromyography (sEMG) to assess arm function in boys with DMD was examined. Methods: Five boys with DMD and 6 age-matched controls participated in this study. Single joint movements and ADL activities were examined while recording sEMG of main shoulder and elbow muscles. Results: All boys with DMD and controls were able to perform the non standardized movements of the measurement protocol, however one boy with DMD was not able to perform all the standardized movements. Boys with DMD used significantly more of their maximal muscle capacity for all muscles to conduct movements compared to controls. Discussion/Conclusion: The measurement protocol was feasible to assess arm function in boys with DMD. This tool was able to discriminate between DMD patients and controls.}

abstract = {Surface EMG comprises a variety of widely applied experimental tools in basic neuroscience, biomechanics and exercise physiology, but also in applied disciplines like clinical neuro-physiology, ergonomics and sports sciences. To increase the usefulness of surface EMG, we contributed to the introduction and application of a spatiotemporal variant of the usual single channel surface EMG techniques, called high-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG). In the present paper, we first discuss the background of the HD-sEMG technique and basic principles of recording and analysis. In a second part, we illustrate the usefulness of the technique on the basis of studies in which the analysis of HD-sEMG at a motor unit level is at hand. It concerns a precise analysis of the activity of the facial musculature that leads to a map of muscle fibre directions and the positions of motor endplate zones. Two other applications refer to neuromuscular pathology, being motor unit number estimation and the quantification of spontaneous motor unit activity, known as fasciculations.}

  abstract = "Voluntary surface electromyogram (EMG) signals from neurological
              injury patients are often corrupted by involuntary background
              interference or spikes, imposing difficulties for myoelectric
              control. We present a novel framework to suppress involuntary
              background spikes during voluntary surface EMG recordings. The
              framework applies a Wiener filter to restore voluntary surface
              EMG signals based on tracking a priori signal to noise ratio
              (SNR) by using the decision-directed method. Semi-synthetic
              surface EMG signals contaminated by different levels of
              involuntary background spikes were constructed from a database of
              surface EMG recordings in a group of spinal cord injury subjects.
              After the processing, the onset detection of voluntary muscle
              activity was significantly improved against involuntary
              background spikes. The magnitude of voluntary surface EMG signals
              can also be reliably estimated for myoelectric control purpose.
              Compared with the previous sample entropy analysis for
              suppressing involuntary background spikes, the proposed framework
              is characterized by quick and simple implementation, making it

abstract={The main objective of this work is to establish a framework for processing and evaluating the lower limb electromyography (EMG) signals ready to be fed to a rehabilitation robot. We design and build a knee rehabilitation robot that works with surface EMG (sEMG) signals. In our device, the muscle forces are estimated from sEMG signals using several machine learning techniques, i.e. support vector machine (SVM), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF). In order to improve the estimation accuracy, we devise genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimisation and feature extraction within the proposed methods. At the same time, a load cell and a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) are mounted on the robot to measure the muscle force and knee joint angle, respectively. Various performance measures have been employed to assess the performance of the proposed system. Our extensive experiments and comparison with related works revealed a high estimation accuracy of 98.67{\%} for lower limb muscles. The main advantage of the proposed techniques is high estimation accuracy leading to improved performance of the therapy while muscle models become especially sensitive to the tendon stiffness and the slack length.},

abstract = {This chapter covers all aspects of time series analysis. In this latest edition, the material has been reorganized so that it now starts with basic concepts regarding stochastic processes and introduces correlation functions as the first step toward defining spectral analysis. We examine the application of spectral analysis to stochastic series and discrete series, and provide a thorough treatment of traditional spectral methods. The chi-squared property of spectral estimates is introduced and discussed as a means of evaluating the statistical significance of spectral estimates. Spectral methods for vector series are briefly discussed, as are rotary spectral estimation methods. The effects of temporal or spatial sampling on the resultant spectral estimates are explored and the resultant aliasing is introduced and discussed, as are the implications for frequency resolution. The smoothing of spectral estimates, or windowing, is described and the implications of window selection on the significance of spectral estimates are examined. Simple band averaging is discussed as a smoothing method and the resultant confidence intervals for the spectrum are introduced. The concepts of spectral fidelity and stability are discussed as outcomes of smoothing decisions. The needs for zero padding and prewhitening are then introduced. Next the spectral analysis of unevenly spaced series is a unique topic of this chapter. It also provides a summary of the standard spectral analysis approach. The discussion then shifts to parametric methods of spectral analysis starting with autoregressive power spectral estimation. The maximum entropy spectral method is then introduced along with maximum likelihood spectral estimation. Next is cross-spectral analysis, where we no longer have strict power spectra but must deal with coherence and phase. The Fourier transform method is introduced and the practical applications of this method are detailed. Phase and cross-amplitude functions are discussed along with co- and quadrature spectra. The unique aspects of confidence levels to cross-spectra are then introduced. The frequency response of a linear system is described, along with rotary cross-spectra. Wavelet analysis is subsequently introduced as an alternative to standard spectral methods. Various wavelet algorithms are examined relative to their advantages and disadvantages. Oceanographic examples are presented to show how wavelet analysis can be used. In addition to wavelets the S-transform is discussed along with the multiple filter technique developed by geophysicists. Basic Fourier spectral analysis is then introduced to take advantage of the popular Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) now possible with digital computing facilities. FFT applications to both discrete and continuous time/space series are discussed and detailed. A least-squares FFT method is introduced again as a way of handling gappy time/space series. Computational examples are included with all of these procedures. A discussion of the harmonic analysis as applied to tidal time series is then presented. In earlier editions of this text harmonic analysis was presented before the discussion of spectral methods but the authors now consider harmonic analysis as a subset of the larger spectral analysis and hence it comes later. Computational tidal examples are included here. Special time series methods such as “regime shift detection” (including “sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts,” “adaptive Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filters,” and “cumulative upwelling index”) are introduced and discussed. Vector regression is also suggested as a time series analysis method. Fractals are suggested as another technique to decompose a time series.}

ABSTRACT = {The estimation of the sEMG&ndash;force relationship is an open problem in the scientific literature; current methods show different limitations and can achieve good performance only on limited scenarios, failing to identify a general solution to the optimization of this kind of analysis. In this work, this relationship has been estimated on two different datasets related to isometric force-tracking experiments by calculating the sEMG amplitude using different fixed-time constant moving-window filters, as well as an adaptive time-varying algorithm. Results show how the adaptive methods might be the most appropriate choice for the estimation of the correlation between the sEMG signal and the force time course. Moreover, the comparison between adaptive and standard filters highlights how the time constants exploited in the estimation strategy is not the only influence factor on this kind of analysis; a time-varying approach is able to constantly capture more information with respect to fixed stationary approaches with comparable window lengths.},

  title     = "Interpreting muscle function from {EMG}: lessons learned from
               direct measurements of muscle force",
  author    = "Roberts, Thomas J and Gabald{\'o}n, Annette M",
  abstract  = "Electromyography is often used to infer the pattern of
               production of force by skeletal muscles. The interpretation of
               muscle function from the electromyogram (EMG) is challenged by
               the fact that factors such as type of muscle fiber, muscle
               length, and muscle velocity can all influence the relationship
               between electrical and mechanical activity of a muscle.
               Simultaneous measurements of EMG, muscle force, and fascicle
               length in hindlimb muscles of wild turkeys allow us to probe the
               quantitative link between force and EMG. We examined two
               features of the force-EMG relationship. First, we measured the
               relaxation electromechanical delay (r-EMD) as the time from the
               end of the EMG signal to time of the end of force. This delay
               varied with locomotor speed in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG);
               it was longer at slow walking speeds than for running. This
               variation in r-EMD was not explained by differences in muscle
               length trajectory, as the magnitude of r-EMD was not correlated
               with the velocity of shortening of the muscle during relaxation.
               We speculate that the longer relaxation times at slow walking
               speeds compared with running may reflect the longer time course
               of relaxation in slower muscles fibers. We also examined the
               relationship between magnitude of force and EMG across a range
               of walking and running speeds. We analyzed the force-EMG
               relationship during the swing phase separately from the
               force-EMG relationship during stance phase. During stance, force
               amplitude (average force) was linearly related to mean EMG
               amplitude (average EMG). Forces during swing phase were lower
               than predicted from the stance phase force-EMG relationship. The
               different force-EMG relationships during the stance and swing
               phases may reflect the contribution of passive structures to the
               development of force, or a nonlinear force-EMG relationship at
               low levels of muscle activity. Together the results suggest that
               any inference of force from EMG must be done cautiously when a
               broad range of activities is considered.",

               Pang, S W",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Although electrode size should be miniaturized to
               provide higher selectivity for neural signal recording and to
               avoid tissue damage, small sized electrodes induce high
               impedance, which decreases recording quality. In this work, the
               electrode surface was modified to increase the effective surface
               area to lower the electrode impedance and to improve the neural
               signal detection quality by optimizing plasma conditions.
               APPROACH: A tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma was used to increase
               the effective surface area of gold electrode sites of
               polyimide-based neural probes. In vitro electrode impedance and
               in vivo neural signal recording and stimulation were
               characterized. MAIN RESULTS: For 15 $\mu$m diameter (dia.)
               electrode size, the average surface roughness could be increased
               from 1.7 to 22 nm after plasma treatment, and the electrode
               impedance was decreased by 98\%. Averaged background noise power
               in the range of 1 to 1000 Hz was decreased to -106 dB after the
               30 $\mu$m dia. electrodes were plasma modified-lower than the
               noise level of -86 dB without plasma treatment. Neural probes
               with plasma-modified electrode sites of 15 and 30 $\mu$m dia.
               were implanted to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) region for
               acute recording of spontaneous and electrical evoked local field
               potential (LFP) of neural signals. Spontaneous LFP recorded in
               vivo by the plasma-modified electrodes of 30 $\mu$m dia. was two
               times higher compared to electrodes without treatment. For a
               stimulation current of 400 $\mu$A, electrically evoked LFP
               recorded by the plasma-modified electrodes was seven times
               higher than those without plasma exposure. SIGNIFICANCE: A
               controllable technology was developed to increase the effective
               surface area of electrodes using a CF4 plasma. Plasma-modified
               electrodes improved the quality of the neural probe recording
               and more sensitive to record spontaneous and evoked LFP in the
               ACC region.",

ABSTRACT={Amputation of the upper limb brings heavy burden to amputees, reduces their quality of life, and limits their performance in activities of daily life. The realization of natural control for prosthetic hands is crucial to improving the quality of life of amputees. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal is one of the most widely used biological signals for the prediction of upper limb motor intention, which is an essential element of the control systems of prosthetic hands. The conversion of sEMG signals into effective control signals often requires a lot of computational power and complex process. Existing commercial prosthetic hands can only provide natural control for very few active degrees of freedom. Deep learning (DL) has performed surprisingly well in the development of intelligent systems in recent years. The significant improvement of hardware equipment and the continuous emergence of large data sets of sEMG have also boosted the DL research in sEMG signal processing. DL can effectively improve the accuracy of sEMG pattern recognition and reduce the influence of interference factors. This paper analyzes the applicability and efficiency of DL in sEMG-based gesture recognition and reviews the key techniques of DL-based sEMG pattern recognition for the prosthetic hand, including signal acquisition, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, classification of patterns, post-processing, and performance evaluation. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in clinical application of these techniques are outlined and discussed.}
