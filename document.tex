\cmgk{General remarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Please adjust title page. Massimo is professor.
    \item Use non-italic font for subscripts indicating a name since it improves readability. E.g. $\phi_\text{C}$ instead of $\phi_C$, unless the subscript represents a variable, e.g. $\phi_i=i\cdot\Delta\phi$ would e.g. be the potential of the $i^{th}$ element. Also use the \LaTeX~names for functions. So `$\tan$' instead of `$tan$' since `$\tan$' is actually a name (of a function), not a variable.
    \item Considering the use of "a" and "an": "an" is used for all words and abbreviations that start with a \emph{vowel}. This does include the consonants that, when spoken out loud, begin with a vowel sound. E.g. "an SEM picture" since SEM is pronounced "es-ee-em". But one would use "a DAC", pronounced "de-a-c".
    \item Use \texttt{siunitx} to obtain very consistent type setting of numbers and units. A single value would e.g. look like \SI{2.8}{\ohm\cm} (\texttt{\tb SI\{2.8\}\{\tb ohm\tb cm\}}. A range \SIrange{2.8}{9}{\ohm\cm}. Note that it takes care to consistently typeset number, unit and spacing. For one thing, units should not be typeset italic!
    \item Try to keep figures and corresponding text close to each other; scrolling through all the pages is not convenient for your readers. If needed you can use \texttt{FloatBarrier} to prevent figures and tables to be moved past a certain point. 
    \item Use \emph{amount, lot of} for uncountable quantities, \emph{many, number of} for countable quantities.
